This is the official documentation for Titanium Network, an organization dedicated to providing services related to bypassing internet censorship. Our projects expect to provide users and themselves with a less restrictive browsing experience. Here, we provide advanced web proxy services through the progression of web proxy technologies.

These projects consist of advanced URL rewriting proxies, webOS projects, web-based emulation built from libretro, kajigs (a repository of device/OS exploits) and web browser experimentations with service workers.
As a result, a wide variety of sites are supported, speed is prioritized, and resource consumption has been significantly optimized compared to previous technologies.

## About
Founded in 2016, Titanium Network is an organization dedicated to providing services related to bypassing internet censorship. Our projects expect to provide users with a less restrictive browsing experience.

For this, Titanium Network prioritizes the production and improvement of web proxy technologies such as Ultraviolet, Corrosion, etc., and the affiliation with various branched projects like Rammerhead, TOMP, and, formerly, Womginx from contributors.

Our Discord has 30,000 members, and Titanium Network's services actively maintain well over 5 million users per month.

## Getting Started

### Unblocking

You simply need to use a site that hosts Ultraviolet, the web proxy project maintained by Titanium Network, or other web proxy projects. To obtain a new URL, join the Titanium Network Discord server and enter the proxy command in the #proxy channel.

With this resource, you can unblock websites in plain terms. The best part about web proxies or a project in Titanium Network is that even after being blocked, there are always new URLs or links. You can't block them all. Sites such as Discord and others are supported on it.

#### Or self-host for complete privacy control!!

### Obtaining Links
Join the TN discord server at: https://discord.gg/unblock

Type out `/proxy` in the #proxy channel, and our Discord bot will direct message you a link. You can do this three to nine times per month, and we restock these links every month to ensure they remain unblocked!

## Proxies
### [Ultraviolet](proxies/ultraviolet)

<img alt="Ultraviolet Logo" align="right" width="200px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet-Static/main/public/uv.png"></img>

- A highly sophisticated proxy used for evading internet censorship or accessing websites in a controlled sandbox utilizing the power of service workers.

Starting from v2, Ultraviolet only supports Bare servers v3+.

If you operate an outdated Bare server, we encourage you to update it. If you're using an outdated Bare server, we encourage you to find an updated Bare server or host your own.

If you're too lazy to do either of the above, you can install an outdated and unsupported version of Ultraviolet.

```
npm install @titaniumnetwork-dev/ultraviolet@1
```

### [Wisp](wisp)

Wisp is designed to be a low-overhead, easy-to-implement protocol for proxying multiple TCP and UDP sockets over a single WebSocket connection. It is the standard for our services.

## Open Source Projects

Titanium Network is composed of various open-source projects hosted in production. Being open source in nature, users can self-host any of these official projects for their privacy control.
