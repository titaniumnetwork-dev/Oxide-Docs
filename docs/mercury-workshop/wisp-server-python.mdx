```
pip3 install wisp-python
```

## Running the Server:
To start the server, run `python3 -m wisp.server`. The program accepts the following arguments:
```
usage: wisp-server-python [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--static STATIC] [--limits] [--bandwidth BANDWIDTH] [--connections CONNECTIONS] [--window WINDOW] [--allow-loopback] [--allow-private]

A Wisp server implementation, written in Python (v0.4.0)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host HOST           The hostname the server will listen on.

                        Bandwidth limit per IP, in kilobytes per second.
  --connections CONNECTIONS
                        New connections limit per IP.
  --window WINDOW       Fixed window length for rate limits, in seconds.
  --allow-loopback      Allow connections to loopback IP addresses.
