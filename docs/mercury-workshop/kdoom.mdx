WIP port of DOOM to the Kindle (seriously, why hasn't anyone done this yet?)

Tested on: Kindle Paperwhite 4, Kindle Basic 10

## Todo

* ~~Scale properly to the screen~~
* ~~Figure out the optimal e-ink waveform for displaying the game~~
* ~~Proper touch input~~
* ~~Test on something other than my (BomberFish's) Paperwhite 4~~
* ~~Kobo?~~ (probably never happening)

## Setup

You will need:
* A jailbroken Kindle. You can check if your firmware is jailbreakable [here](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Firmware).
* KUAL installed. Downloads can be found [here](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030).

Setup is easy as pie (?)
1. Connect your Kindle via USB.
2. Copy your DOOM .wad to the root of the userstore.
3. Copy the kual extension folder to the extensions/ folder inside the userstore.
4. Enjoy! ;)

## Building from source

You will need:
* Everything from the setup guide
* A Linux PC. macOS might work on a good day but you're on your own.
* A compatible toolchain. See below.

Just run the following:
* `git clone https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/kdoom --recurse-submodules`
* `make package`

After that, just follow the installation instructions in "Setup".

## Getting a (compatible) toolchain

> [!WARNING]  
> General support for armhf-based firmware versions is very poor at the moment, since the change is very recent. **YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.**

Amazon changed the architecture the OS uses in a recent software update. You will need a compatible toolchain to build the binaries. Just unzip the desired tc and copy everything inside the x-tools folder to /usr (on Linux; macOS is different)

### ARM soft float (FW <= 5.16.2.1.1)

### ARM hard float (FW > 5.16.2.1.1)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need to append `ARMHF=1` to all `make` commands when building for newer firmware versions.
