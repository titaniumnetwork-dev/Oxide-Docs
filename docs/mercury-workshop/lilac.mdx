it works lmao

[blog post](https://www.r58playz.dev/post/lilac-the-device-policy-story)

## build instructions
- build `boringssl` - source included just clear `boringssl/build` folder and then install to `boringssl/install`
- install `protobuf`
- build the protobuf files - `protoc -I proto proto/* --cpp_out=.`
- run `make`

You may need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=boringssl/install/lib` to run lilac.

## run instructions
- change the release channel to `testimage-channel` in `/etc/lsb-release`
- add `--disable-policy-key-verification` to command line flags (update: you only need to restart chrome with this flag once after you replace the policies)
- run policyeditor on a `policy.*` in `/var/lib/devicesettings`
- overwrite policies and `owner.key` (`owner.key` is saved as `<filename>.key`)

## notes
- you probably need to keep wifi off / fake network error / overwrite policies and restart ui for this to persist
    - apparently not... i have had lilac edited policies with wifi on for multiple weeks, it may not show as online on gac when syncing policies due to a signature error because i overwrite the policy sig
- policies sync every time chrome starts meaning `restart ui` will reload policies + try to fetch them
- protobuf bindings and even the editor may need to be adjusted for different chrome versions i.e. 81 has a completely different policy blob layout which might not allow this editing
