#### Overview

Titanium Network is an organization dedicated to providing services related to bypassing internet censorship. Our projects expect to provide users, and itself, with a less restrictive browsing experience. For this TN prioritizes the production and improvement of web proxy technologies.

#### Why Titanium Network?

- A massive proxy and bypass community (sub 30k), home to some of the best proxies online
- Utilize our "Kajig" bypass methods for an even smoother bypass experience

#### Local Setup

Make sure to have both Node.js and yarn installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Oxide.git
cd Oxide
yarn
yarn dev
```

A browser tab will automatically open to `localhost:3000` (the default port).

For production, you may use the commands:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

However, it is simpler to use a reverse proxy that serves the static files generated by `yarn`. The generated files can be found in the `/out` directory.
