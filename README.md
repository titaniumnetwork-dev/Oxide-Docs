# Oxide-Docs

The official SDK documentation site for Titanium Network. Here we provide
advanced web proxy services through the progression of web proxy technologies.
This composes from advanced URL rewriting proxies, webOS projects, web-based
emulation built from libretro, kajigs (a repository of device/OS exploits) and
also web browser experimentations with service-workers. As a result a wide
variety of sites are supported, speed is prioritized and resource consumption
has also been significantly optimized compared to previous technologies.
