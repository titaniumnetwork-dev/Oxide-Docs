Holy Unblocker LTS, an experimental web proxy service, can bypass web filters or 'blockers' regardless of whether the method of censorship is client-side or network-based. This includes the potential ability to bypass content blockers overseas, Chrome extensions, localized client firewalls, and network-related filters.

## You can support Holy Unblocker by starring the repository!

This project serves mostly as a proof of concept for the ideal clientless solution to bypassing censorship. Being a secure web proxy service, it supports numerous sites while being updated frequently and concentrating on detail with design, mechanics, and features.

Works with a large number of sites, including YouTube, Discord, and more!
Also has a good amount of locally hosted games featured on the site.

:::tip
Holy Unblocker LTS is optimized for self-hosting to provide you with maximum privacy control! Fork this repository and consider starring. You can self-host using either free or paid deployment options, or set it up on a dedicated instance (VPS) for enhanced performance.

## Detailed FAQ
<details>
<summary>Quick FAQ</summary>

#### Where can I find the games for this repo? (404 errors, etc.)
Due to piracy concerns, size, etc. this has been moved over [here](https://github.com/QuiteAFancyEmerald/HU-Archive). EmuLibrary is not featured in the public version.

**Why is the site I am on not working correctly or having CAPTCHA errors?**

Captcha support is currently not available on all of the current proxies sadly. Therefore some sites may not work with any of the sites. Read below for issues with links on sites.

**I am getting 502 errors. What do I do?**

When this happens you may either switch sites to fix the error or wait a bit. Sometimes clearing your cache can help.

If you still have any questions feel free to ask them in the discord linked here.

### Why are official domains now numbered? Is this project maintained again?
Yes, this project is active again for LTS support! However, the approach is now much simpler to ensure functionality: traffic will be focused on a single domain. More than ever, this project serves as a proof of concept for the brave souls willing to innovate in the web proxy service space.
