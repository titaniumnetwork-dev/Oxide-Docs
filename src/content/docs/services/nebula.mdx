# Catalog/Marketplace

- By default, the marketplace is enabled and uses SQLite
  - If you encounter any issues with SQLite3, please run the `fix_sqlite3.sh{:sh}` script
- If you would like to disable the catalog, see [#config](#config)
- For big production instances, I recommend using PostgreSQL rather than SQLite. To do this see [#config](#config)
- To use PostgreSQL via the provided docker-compose files, see [#docker](#docker)

## How to make a theme

- Themes allow you to customize Nebula's *look*.

### Prerequisites:

- Make sure you have our Discord server so you can submit your theme

#### Making the themes:

1. Firstly, copy the CSS vars:

```css
:root {
  --background-primary: /*Your stuff here */;
  --background-lighter: ;
  --navbar-color: ;
  --navbar-text-color: ;
  --navbar-link-color: ; 
  --navbar-link-hover-color: ; 
  --input-text-color: ;
  --input-placeholder-color: ; 
  --input-background-color: ;
  --input-border-color: ;
  --tab-color: ;
  --border-color: ; 
}
```

:::note
You can add a custom font as well! To do so, add this to your `:root{:css}`

```css
--font-family: /* Font family name */;
```

And this to the bottom of your CSS file/submission:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: /* Name */;
    src: url(/* Where the font is located! Local or external work! */);
   }
```

A good example of using a custom font is the built-in `retro` theme [here](https://github.com/NebulaServices/Nebula/tree/main/database_assets/com.nebula.retro)
:::

2. Add your colors and test! (Either with a self-hosted version of Nebula OR via a live preview (no clue when this will happen)

3. Once you're satisfied with the colors, submit your theme to the Discord Server!

## How to make a plugin

- Plugins extend the functionality of either the proxied page(s) or the service worker.
- This guide provides an incredibly basic example of how to make either.

### Prerequisites:

- Make sure you have joined our Discord server so you can submit your plugin.
- Some knowledge of JS/TS

#### Serviceworker plugin:

- These plugins are handled by Workerware see [here](/technologies/workerware) for docs.

1. Create an index.js (or other file name) file:

```sh
touch index.js
```

2. Edit that file to include either of these:
   - Code encased in a string:
   ```js
   function setup() {
       // This function MUST return the following attributes:
       return {
           function: `console.log('Example code.')`,
           name: 'com.example', // Technically, it could be named anything. It is recommended to use the same name for everything (name when submitting and this)        
           events: ['fetch'] // See: /technologies/workerware for the event types you can use. (Also typed if you are using typescript)
       }
   }

   //This can be named anything. However, it's recommended to use `entryFunc` (with types, the naming IS enforced)
   self.entryFunc = setup; //DO NOT call the function here. Only assign the reference otherwise, it will error.
   ```
   - Code in an arrow function:
   ```js
   const example = () => {
       console.log('Example code')
   }

   function setup() {
       //This function MUST return the following attributes:
       return {
           function: example, //Do not call the function, only assign the reference to the function.
           name: 'com.example', // Technicall could be name anything. Recommended to use the same name for everything (name when submitting and this)
           event: ['fetch'] // See /technologies/workerware for the event types you can use. (Also typed if using typescript)
       }
   }

   //This can be named anything. However, it's recommended to use `entryFunc` (with types, the naming IS enforced)
   self.entryFunc = setup; //DO NOT call the function here. Only assign the reference; otherwise, it will result in an error.
   ```

:::caution
The only *allowed* way to pass code to the `function` param is either a string or an arrow function. Named functions ***WILL NOT WORK***.

Example of a named function: `function example() {/* Some form of code */}{:js}`.

If a named function is used where it shouldn't be, your plugin will not be approved, nor will it work properly.
:::

3. Submit your plugin in the Discord!

#### Proxied page plugins

- They allow modification of websites that UV proxies, (EX: you could add Vencord to Discord with this)

1. Create an index.js file (or another file name)

```sh
touch index.js
```

2. Edit that file with your code and the following:

```js
//Name this whatever.
function example() {
    //You MUST return the following
    return {
        host: "example.com", //The host to match (so if the user visits example.com it will inject the html below.
        html: "<script>console.log('Example')</script>", //Must return a string (and be valid HTML or your plugin will break). How you get that string is up to you
        injectTo: "head" // Can be "head" or "body"
    }
}

// Technically, this could be named anything, it is recommended to call it `entryFunc`
self.entryFunc = example; //DO NOT run the function here. That will cause errors. Only assign the reference to the function here.
```

3. Submit it in our Discord!

# Deployment

## Terminal

Prerequisites:

- Node & npm (pnpm recommended!)
- Git

0. Install pnpm

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nebulaservices/nebula --recursive && cd nebula
```

2. Install all of the dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i
```

3. Create a `config.toml` file

```sh
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

4. Modify the `config.toml` file to your liking (docs [here](#environment))

```sh
nano config.toml
```

5. Build the front end & server:

```bash
pnpm build
```

6. Start the server

```sh
pnpm start
```

:::note
You can run `pnpm bstart{:sh}` to build and start together
:::

## Docker

:::caution
**CURRENTLY DOCKER DOES NOT WORK!! For some reason the docker image doesn't exist in Dockhub**
:::

- There are two ways to deploy with docker:
  - [Normal docker](#normal-docker)
  - [Docker Compose](#docker-compose)

#### Normal Docker

Prerequisites:

- Git
- Docker

1. Clone the repo (skip if using a prebuilt image):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nebulaservices/nebula --recursive && cd nebula
```

2. Create an `config.toml` file (if using prebuilt image, copy the example from the repo):

```sh
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

3. Modify the `config.toml` file to your liking (docs [here](#environment))

```sh
nano config.toml
```

4. Build the docker image (skip if using prebuilt):

```sh
docker build nebula:latest
```

5. Run the docker images:

   - Prebuilt:

   ```sh
   docker run -v ./config.toml:/app/config.toml ghcr.io/nebulaservices/nebula:latest
   ```

   - Image you built yourself:

   ```sh
   docker run -v ./config.toml:/app/config.toml nebula:latest
   ```

#### Docker Compose

Prerequisites:

- Git
- Docker w/compose

1. Clone the repo (skip if using a prebuilt image):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nebulaservices/nebula --recursive
```

2. Create an `config.toml` file (if using prebuilt image, copy the example from the repo):

```sh
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

3. Modify the `config.toml` file to your liking (docs on that [here](#environment)]

```sh
nano config.toml
```

4. Build the Docker image (skip if using prebuilt):

```sh
docker compose -f ./docker-compose.build.yml build
```

5. Run the docker image:

   - Prebuilt:

   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```

   - Image you built yourself:

   ```sh
   docker compose -f ./docker-compose.build.yml up
   ```

### Extra (Postgres)

- To use Postgres over SQLite, uncomment the DB section in the `docker-compose` file (or use your own Postgres DB!). Then, modify the `config.toml` (See: [#config](#config) for knowledge on how to do this)
- To use Postgres over SQLite in a normal docker environment (no compose), you'll have to set one up and then modify the `config.toml` to use it. (See: [#config](#config) for knowledge on how to do this)

# Config

There are a couple of configuration options for Nebula. The defaults are fine most of the time, but there are instances where you may not want certain options enabled or certain things running.

- Config format is in TOML
