:::tip
You **can not** host DDX locally via a static web hosting site such as Netlify, Github Pages, and Cloudflare Pages.
:::

We recommend using the Bun package manager to install DayDreamX's dependencies. However, DayDreamX contains lock files for three major package managers: npm, pnpm, and bun.

Please run the following commands to host a server:

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/NightProxy/DayDreamX.git
cd DayDreamX
npm i
npm start
```

In the above example, replace `npm` with `bun` or `pnpm` for whichever package manager you wish to use.

# Updating

```sh
git pull --force --allow-unrelated-histories
```
