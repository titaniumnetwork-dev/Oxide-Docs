## What is AnuraOS?

An entirely local browser "OS" and development environment with complete graphical linux emulation, visually based on chromiumOS. See a demo [here](https://anura.pro), fully in your browser.

:::caution
Anura mainly targets Chromium but should work on most browsers. For a list of known browser specific quirks check this [document](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/anuraOS/blob/main/BrowserQuirks.md).
:::

Anura uses the features of a progressive web app to make its environment work fully offline, providing a virtual filesystem (synced with the linux emulator), a code editor, and a modular and extensible app system. You can even edit Anura's code live while inside of it!

Anura shows as more of a proof-of-concept with what's possible on the modern web rather than an actual product. However, it proves useful in many actual cases and is a useful educational tool.

# Development

:::danger
Anura will not build on Windows. Please use a Linux VM or WSL.
:::

### Easy Install for GitHub Codespaces

- Run `source codespace-basic-setup.sh{:sh}`

:::note
If you are not in a codespace skip to the regular installation steps.
:::

:::caution
This does NOT build RootFS.
:::

### Dependencies

- Recent versions of `node.js` and `npm`
- `wget`
- A recent version of `java` (11+)
- `inotifytools`
- `rustup`
- `wasm-opt`
- `make`
- `gcc` (`gcc-multilib` on Debian and Ubuntu x86\_64)
- `clang`
- `uuid-runtime`
- `jq`
- `docker`
- An x86(-64) Linux PC (`make rootfs-alpine` build depends on x86 specific tools)

:::note
You will have to install the required Rust toolchains by running `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown{:sh}` and `rustup target add i686-unknown-linux-gnu{:sh}` if you are planning to build v86 images.
:::

### Building

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/anuraOS
make all
```

:::tip
You can use `make all -B{:sh}` instead if you want to force a full build.
:::

### Building the Linux RootFS

- Make sure you have `Docker` installed and running.

```bash
make rootfs
usermod -a -G docker $USER
```

### Running Anura Locally

You can run Anura with the command

```bash
make server
```

Anura should now be running at `localhost:8000`.
