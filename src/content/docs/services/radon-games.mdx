## Adding Games

In order to add games to Radon, you will first need to download the game files using some form of a website scraper. Once you have the game files, you will have to upload them to the [Radon-Games-Assets](https://github.com/Radon-Games/Radon-Games-Assets) in the corresponding folder. Once the games have been uploaded to the repository, you will need to edit [`src/data/games.json`](https://github.com/cohenerickson/Radon-Games/blob/main/src/data/games.json) and add an entry for the game.
