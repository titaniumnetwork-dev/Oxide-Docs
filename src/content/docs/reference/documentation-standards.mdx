This document outlines the writing standards and formatting conventions used throughout the Oxide-Docs project, derived from analysis of existing documentation.

# Frontmatter Standards

All MDX files use YAML frontmatter for metadata:

## Basic Page Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: Brief description of the page content
keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
---
```

## Proxy/Technology/Transport Pages

```yaml
---
title: Project Name
description: Brief description
keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
themeColor: "#ffa660"  # Optional: brand color
github: "https://github.com/org/repo"
official-link: "https://example.com"
order: 1  # Optional: sidebar ordering
---
```

## Organization Pages

```yaml
---
title: Organization Name
sidebar:
  order: 1  # Position in sidebar
category: [organizations]
github: "https://github.com/org"
official-link: "https://example.com"
---
```

# Writing Style

## Tone

- **Professional but approachable**
- **Clear and concise**
- **Technically accurate**
- **Community-focused**

## Voice

- Use active voice: "Scramjet provides" not "is provided by"
- Direct address: "You can install" not "One can install"
- Present tense for current features
- Be specific, not vague

## Technical Terms

- **First mention**: Full name with abbreviation in parentheses
- **Subsequent mentions**: Use abbreviation or short form
- **Example**: "Service Worker (SW)" → later use "SW"

### Example from Scramjet docs:

> "In the proxy community, you may see it abbreviated as 'SJ'."

# Structure Patterns

## Page Organization

### 1. Opening Section

- Brief description (1-2 sentences)
- Key features or value proposition
- Context about the project's role

### 2. Feature List

Use bullet points with **bold headings**:

```markdown
- **Feature Name**: Brief description
- **Another Feature**: Brief description
```

### 3. Installation/Setup

````markdown
# Installation

```bash
npm install package-name
````

## Dependencies

List required packages...

````

### 4. Usage Examples
- Start simple, progress to complex
- Include both code and explanations
- Show real-world use cases

### 5. Advanced Topics
- Separate advanced features into subsections
- Use clear hierarchical headings

### 6. Related Links
End with links to:
- GitHub repository
- Official documentation
- Related projects
- Community resources

## Heading Hierarchy

```markdown
# H1: Main Title (Page Title)
## H2: Major Sections
### H3: Subsections
#### H4: Detailed Breakdowns
````

**Rules:**

- Only one H1 per page (the title)
- Don't skip heading levels
- Keep headings concise (3-7 words)
- Use sentence case, not title case

# Code Examples

## Inline Code

Use backticks for:

- File names: `package.json`
- Function names: `setTransport()`
- Variable names: `connection`
- Short code snippets: `const api = new API()`

### Example:

> The class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.

## Code Blocks

### With Language Identifier

````markdown
```javascript
const example = "code";
```
````

### With Highlighting

````markdown
```js
import { scramjetPath } from "@mercuryworkshop/scramjet/path"{:js}
```
````

### Shell Commands

````markdown
```bash
npm install package-name
```

```sh
pnpm i @mercuryworkshop/scramjet@2.0.0-alpha
```
````

## File Examples

Show file paths as comments:

````markdown
`sw.js`:

```js
importScripts("/scram/scramjet.all.js");
// ... code
```
````

# Admonitions (Callout Boxes)

## Note

For general information or tips:

```markdown
:::note
In the proxy community, you may see it abbreviated as "SJ".
:::
```

## Caution/Warning

For important warnings:

```markdown
:::caution
Fixed types haven't landed in the NPM package yet.
:::
```

## Note with Title

```markdown
:::note[Custom Title]
Content goes here.
:::
```

## When to Use

- **Note**: Non-critical information, helpful tips
- **Caution**: Important limitations or gotchas
- **Warning**: Critical issues that could cause problems
- **Tip**: Best practices or recommendations

# Links

## Internal Links (Same Site)

```markdown
[**Scramjet**](../proxies/scramjet.mdx)
[transport guide](../transports/using-transports.mdx)
```

**Pattern:**

- Use relative paths
- Include `.mdx` extension
- Use `../` to go up directories
- Bold important project names

## External Links

```markdown
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/org/repo)
[Official Documentation](https://example.com/docs)
```

## Link in Lists

```markdown
- [**Project Name**](../category/project.mdx) - Brief description
```

# Lists

## Unordered Lists

```markdown
- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Item three
```

## Ordered Lists

```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

## Definition Lists

```markdown
- **Term**: Definition or explanation
- **Another Term**: Another definition
```

# Images

## With Alt Text

```markdown
![Official Logo](https://example.com/logo.png)
```

## With Sizing

```markdown
<img width="200px" align="right" src="..." alt="..." height="250" />
```

## Placeholder Images

```markdown
![Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200/1a1a2e/eee?text=Text)
```

# Tables

Use Markdown tables for structured data:

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |
```

# Code Documentation Patterns

## API Methods

### Method Signature

````markdown
### methodName()

```typescript
async methodName(param: Type): Promise<ReturnType>
````

Brief description.

**Parameters:**

- `param` (Type): Description

**Returns:**

- `Promise<ReturnType>` - Description

**Example:**

```javascript
const result = await api.methodName(value);
```

````

## Interface Documentation
```markdown
**InterfaceName Interface:**
```typescript
interface InterfaceName {
  property: string;
  optional?: number;
}
````

````

## Configuration Options
```markdown
**Options:**
- `option1` (type): Description (default: value)
- `option2` (type): Description
````

# Formatting Best Practices

## Emphasis

### Bold

Use for:

- **Feature names**
- **Important terms** on first use
- **Key concepts**
- **Section emphasis**

### Italic

Use sparingly for:

- *Emphasis within a sentence*
- *Book/document titles*

### Bold + Italic

Use very rarely for ***critical warnings***

## Lists vs. Paragraphs

- Use lists for: Multiple related items, steps, options
- Use paragraphs for: Explanations, descriptions, narrative

## Code vs. Text

- Use code formatting for anything a user would type or see in code
- Use regular text for concepts and explanations

# Section-Specific Patterns

```markdown
---
title: Organization Name
