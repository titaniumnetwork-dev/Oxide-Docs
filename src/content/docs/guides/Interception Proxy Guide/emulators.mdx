# Types of Emulation

Everything, which needs to be emulated includes: errors for all major browsers, Nested SWs, caching, and every security policy.

### CORS Emulation

## Cache Emulation

## Nested SWs

This refers to an interception-focused method of emulation, where you:

1. Create a fake API for the Navigator SW API
2. Communicate with message listeners on the SW, which will bundle. By bundle I mean resolving the `importScripts` in classic scripts and ESM in module scripts.
