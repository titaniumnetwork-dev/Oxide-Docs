The job of sandboxers are to trick the proxied site into thinking it is in its proxied origin. It contains the interceptors and emulators for a web proxy. Sandboxers are injected into the client  by the SW handler of the SW proxy.

Some sandboxers are flexible to be used in other proxies or for other isolation reasions, such as [Wombat](https://github.com/webrecorder/wombat). It's recommended that you at least try to make your own sandboxer for the experience before you use an pre-existing solution, so you can have a fundemental understanding of why sandboxing is needed.
