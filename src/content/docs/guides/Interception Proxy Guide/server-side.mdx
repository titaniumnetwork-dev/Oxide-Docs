:::warning
This document is still an emerging development, and Scramjet is currently working on adding server-side support.
:::

Fetch Handlers refer to an abstracted part of the SW fetch event handler, which will:

1. Take in destructured Requests, dynamic persisted data usually comes from IndexedDB, a BareMux Client.
2. Rewrite the content like usual.
3. Return a destructured Response.

You would create these Fetch Handlers when you determine it is time to make your SW proxy run in the server.
This is important because not every environment supports SWs, including webviews, some mobile browsers, and browsers that use legacy browser engines such as [Goanna](https://www.palemoon.org/tech/goanna.shtml).

To reduce repeated code, you can use an IndexedDB shim like [indexeddbshim](https://www.npmjs.com/package/indexeddbshim).
Replace client \<-\> message RPC with a WS-based API.

You should also make an ENV var to load a Scramjet config on disk, and have a default config location.
