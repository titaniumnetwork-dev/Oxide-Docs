## Getting Started

For this tutorial, [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) will be used. You can use other open-source clients that utilize **Let's Encrypt** if you wish.

> Certbot is a free, open-source software tool for automatically using Let's Encrypt certificates on manually administered websites to enable HTTPS.

Certbot is an interface with the Let's Encrypt service, a CLI tool for generating and renewing certificates. In this example, Canonical Ubuntu 20.04 will be used.

First, you will want to run some essential commands:

```sh
sudo apt update 
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install certbot
```

You can also look into installing either `python3-certbot-apache` or `python3-certbot-nginx` as well for automatic usage. The status of these plugins can be viewed using the command below:

```sh
certbot plugins
```

## CLI Usage

Standalone mode will be the priority for this tutorial.

`--manual`: Specifies whether or not plugins will be used to make this automatic

`--preferred-challenges`: Can either be DNS or HTTP. DNS is the preferred option as for verification you will resort to adding a TXT record to your zone.

`--d`: Specifies the domain that will be used for renewal

```sh
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d \*.example.com
```

Note how the domain is wildcarded. This is particularly important for users who wish to maintain an active proxy service with many domains/subdomains.
