:::note
This relies on you being below version 129. See [ChromeOS Versions](/kajigs/crosver).
:::

1. Create or log into a Proton VPN account

[https://account.protonvpn.com/signup](https://account.protonvpn.com/signup)

2. Once you have an account go to "account" > "OpenVPN / IKEv2 username"
3. Copy the username and password
4. Unzip the files and choose any server that you want to use (like `us-19` or similar)
5. Edit it in the Text editor app (it's a built-in Chrome app on Chromebook) or any other text editor
6. All the way at the end, after `"TLSAuthContents": "-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----"` put in:

```
   ,
          "Username": "(Put your username here)",
          "Password": "(Put your password here)"
```

You can just copy and paste it and you'll get the right formatting.

Make sure that you start the paste right after the end quotation mark.

7. Save the `.onc` file
8. Upload it to `chrome://network#general` all the way at the bottom where it says "Import ONC File" (don't worry if you don't notice anything, just try scrolling down a little more and it should say `Networks imported: 1` regardless of how many you actually imported)
