# Info

Shimboot is a collection of scripts for patching a Chrome OS RMA shim to serve as a bootloader for a standard Linux distribution. It allows you to boot a full desktop Debian install on a Chromebook, without needing to unenroll it or modify the firmware.

# Explanation

Chrome OS RMA shims are bootable disk images which are designed to run a variety of diagnostic utilities on Chromebooks, and they'll work even if the device is enterprise enrolled. Unfortunately for Google, there exists a security flaw in which the root filesystem of the RMA shim is not verified. This lets us replace the rootfs with anything we want, including a full Linux distribution.

Simply replacing the shim's `rootfs` doesn't work, however, as it boots to an environment friendly to the RMA shim, not regular Linux distros. To get around this, a separate bootloader is required to transition from the shim environment to the main `rootfs`. This bootloader then does a `pivot_root{:sh}` to enter the `rootfs`, where it runs the init system.

Another problem is encountered at this stage: the Chrome OS kernel will complain about `systemd`'s mounts, and the boot process will hang. A simple workaround is to apply a patch to `systemd`, and then it can be recompiled and hosted at a repo somewhere.

After copying all the firmware from the recovery image and shim to the `rootfs`, we're able to boot to a mostly working XFCE desktop.

# Prebuilt Images

Prebuilt images are available here. If there is not a prebuilt image for your board, you must manually build the shimboot image.

For these images, the root password is "root". The name of the default user is "user" and its password is "user" as well. You should change these credentials as soon as possible.

# Build Instructions

1. Find the board name of your Chromebook. You can search for the model name on [Chrome OS Downloads](https://cros.download/).
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/ading2210/shimboot && cd shimboot`
3. Run `sudo ./build_complete.sh [board_name]` to download the required data and build the disk image.

Alternatively, you can run each of the steps manually:

1. Grab a Chrome OS RMA Shim from somewhere. Most of them have already been leaked and aren't too difficult to find.
2. Download a Chrome OS recovery image for your board.
3. Run `mkdir -p data/rootfs` to create a directory to hold the `rootfs`.
4. Run `sudo ./build_rootfs.sh data/rootfs bookworm` to build the base `rootfs`.
5. Run `sudo ./patch_rootfs.sh path_to_shim path_to_reco data/rootfs` to patch the base `rootfs` and add any needed drivers.
6. Run `sudo ./build.sh image.bin path_to_shim data/rootfs` to generate a disk image at `image.bin`.

# Booting the Image

Booting the Image:

1. Obtain a shimboot image by downloading a prebuilt one or building it yourself.
2. Flash the shimboot image to a USB drive or SD card. Use the Chromebook Recovery Utility or `dd` if you're on Linux.
3. Enable developer mode on your Chromebook. If the Chromebook is enrolled, follow the instructions on the [SH1MMER website](https://sh1mmer.me/).
4. Plug the USB into your Chromebook and enter recovery mode. It should detect the USB and run the shimboot bootloader.
5. Boot into Debian and log in with the username and password that you configured earlier. The default username/password for the prebuilt images is `user/user`.
6. Expand the `rootfs` partition so that it fills up the entire disk by running `sudo growpart /dev/sdX 4` (replacing `sdX` with the block device corresponding to your disk) to expand the partition, then running `sudo resize2fs /dev/sdX4` to expand the filesystem.
7. Change the root password and regular user password by running `sudo passwd root` and `passwd user`.
