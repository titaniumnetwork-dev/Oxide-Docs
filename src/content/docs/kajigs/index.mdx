## What is a kajig?

Kajigs are exploits/tools, typically made for use on managed devices.

#### Where can I find them?

Kajigs can be found in [Titanium Network's Discord server](https://discord.gg/unblock) after verifying. Kajigs are located in the `kajig-the-things` category. This category has several kajig-related channels listed below.

1. `#kajigs-info`: Has information about the various tags/categories that kajigs have
2. `#kajigs-helpdesk`: A threads channel for recieving help from TN's Librarians.
3. `#kajigs`: The main kajigs threads channel, for things such as Chromebooks, iOS devices, and Windows devices.
4. `#webview-kajigs`: Threads channel exclusively for exploits allowing limited, but unblocked browsers
5. `#read-only-kajigs`: Threads channel containing exploits that are locked. Not much in here, aside from [Galapagos](/kajigs/galapagos)
6. `#kajigs-discussion`: Talk about kajigs in general, if you use it for help you probably won't get an answer. (See: `#kajigs-helpdesk`)

#### Who makes kajigs?

Kajigs can be posted by anyone with the `Programmer` or `samyk` roles in the Discord server. Webview Kajigs can be posted by anyone.

  ### What kajigs can I use?

  This depends. For extension bypasses, Please see [Non-ChromeOS Exploits](/kajigs/notcros)

  For ChromeOS Exploits, Refer to the information below.

  #### What is a Kernver?

  A Kernver is ChromeOS's ***Kern***&#x65;l ***Ver***&#x73;ion. (Hence, Kernver)

  Kernvers are used by Google to lock the Chromebook to a range of ChromeOS versions, with the purpose of patching exploits.

  While your device is in a Kernver (read which versions those encapsulate below), the lowest recoverable ChromeOS version is the bottom of the Kernver's range.

  [Read more about downgrading and how to recover here.](/kajigs/versions)

  Now, about the table below. If you are at a ***higher*** Kernver than a listed kajig, you cannot use it.

  If you are at a ***lower*** Kernver, you can do it. If a kajig cannot be used on a lower Kernver, it will be highlighted a vibrant pink and stated in the kajig's page.

  :::note
  If you are able and willing to, you can change your Kernver [Unenrolling](/kajigs/unenrollment) and [Changing your Kernver](/kajigs/set-kernver).

                                      <tr key={kv}>
                                        <td>{Array.isArray(ver) ? ver[0] : kv}</td>
                                        <td>{Array.isArray(ver) ? ver[1] : ver}</td>
                                        <td>{kernver[kv]?.map((k) => <a style={{ textDecoration: "none", color: k.color }} href={k.slug}>{k.title}</a>).reduce((a, b) => [a, ", ", b])}</td>
                                      </tr>
                                    ))}
    </tbody>
  </table>

  :::note
  If you are on Kernver 1, you can recover to any version. However, if a kajig is listed as Kernver 1, it can only be done below v112.
