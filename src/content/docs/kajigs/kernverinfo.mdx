title: ChromeOS Kernel Versions

## What is a kernver and what does it mean for me?
Kernel verisons, often referred to as kernvers, are what chromebooks use to lock down how low of a version you can update to. 

If you are on these kernvers, these are the minimum chromeos versions you can use.

| Kernver  | Minimum Chromeos Verison |
|---|------|
| 0 | any  |
| 1 | any  |
| 2 | v111 |
| 3 | v120 |
| 4 | v125 |


## Determining your kernver
1. Hold esc+power+refresh for a bit less than a second
2. Once the recovery screen appears, press tab
3. It should show a line that starts with "TPM:" and ends with "0", "1", "2", "3", or "4". If its a higher number, this doc is probably not up to date. The number it ends with is your kernver.
