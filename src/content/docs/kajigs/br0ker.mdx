It requires you to be on v132 or lower, which can be achieved by downgrading to v132 LTS. You can also get the bundled update with Sh1mmer, by building with it's [update payload](/kajigs/sh1mmer#update-payload)

### How do I use Br0ker?

Sh1mmer only:

1. Boot [Sh1mmer](/kajigs/sh1mmer#booting)
2. Select `Payloads`
3. Select `Br0ker (unenrollment up to kernver 5)`

BadApple + Sh1mmer:

1. Enter [BadApple](/kajigs/badapple)
2. Plug in your Sh1mmer USB drive
3. Find your USB device by running
   ```
   ls /dev/sd*
   ```
   and noting what shows up. (We'll be using /dev/sdX as an example, but you must replace "X" with the correct letter.)
4. Run these commands:
   ```
   mkdir -p /mnt/sh1mmer
   mount -o ro /dev/sdX /mnt/sh1mmer
   sh /mnt/sh1mmer/root/noarch/payloads/br0ker.sh
   ```

Sh1ttyOOBE + BadRecovery + Sh1mmer (v135-137)

1. Perform [Sh1ttyOOBE](/kajigs/sh1ttyoobe), press \[Esc+Ref+Pwr], and enter developer mode
2. Enter unverified [BadRecovery](/kajigs/badrecovery), ignore errors, and wait for the shell.
3. Once it fully loads, unplug the USB drive used for BadRecovery
4. Plug in your Sh1mmer USB drive
5. Find your USB device by running
   ```
   ls /dev/sd*
   ```
   and noting what shows up. (We'll be using /dev/sdX as an example, but you must replace "X" with the correct letter.)
6. Run these commands:
   ```
   mkdir -p /mnt/sh1mmer
   mount -o ro /dev/sdX /mnt/sh1mmer
   sh /mnt/sh1mmer/root/noarch/payloads/br0ker.sh
   ```

Sh1ttyOOBE + BadBr0ker (v135-137)

1. Perform [Sh1ttyOOBE](/kajigs/sh1ttyoobe), press \[Esc+Ref+Pwr], and enter developer mode.
2. Enter [BadBr0ker](https://github.com/crosbreaker/badbr0ker?tab=readme-ov-file#i-have-a-usb-what-now).
3. While **still** in developer mode, press \[Ctrl+Alt+Ref], login as "root" run the following commands.
   ```
   echo --enterprise-enable-unified-state-determination=never >/tmp/chrome_dev.conf
   echo --enterprise-enable-forced-re-enrollment=never >>/tmp/chrome_dev.conf
   echo --enterprise-enable-initial-enrollment=never >>/tmp/chrome_dev.conf
   mount --bind /tmp/chrome_dev.conf /etc/chrome_dev.conf
   initctl restart ui
   ```
4. Press \[Ctrl+Alt+GoBack] and set up the device fully through the setup process. DO NOT POWER OFF THE DEVICE UNTIL FULLY SETUP, OR UNENROLLMENT WILL FAIL.
