# Quicksilver - unenrollment from v125 - v142 (kv4 - kv6)
Quicksilver is an exploit for ChromeOS devices allowing for unenrollment on devices v125 or above (kv4) and v142 or below (kv6)
Don't know what your ChromeOS version or kernver is? [Check here](/kajigs/versions)
## How to use
### If your device can boot SH1MMER (unkeyrolled):
1. Boot SH1MMER (make sure the version is from at least December 15th 2025)
2. Open the payloads menu and run the quicksilver payload
3. Go through setup, you should be unenrolled!! 
-# if your version is from before December 15th 2025, run this command in the bash shell: `vpd -i RW_VPD -s re_enrollment_key="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"`. it will say `unable to write 'random state'`, ignore this
### If your device cannot boot SH1MMER (keyrolled):
1. Do [Sh1ttyExec](/kajigs/sh1ttyexec)
2. Enable developer mode & then enter recovery mode again
3. Boot a [GoodSilver](https://unenrollment.com/GoodSilver/) image and choose "Deprosivion"
4. After it reboots, go through setup, you will be unenrolled!!
## This is persistent if you're on an unpatched version (<=v142)! If you're not updated & want to re-enroll run `vpd -i RW_VPD -d "re_enrollment_key"` in any shell
