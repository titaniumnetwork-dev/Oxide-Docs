3. Click 'Set as Wallpaper'

## Really old versions (v99-v104)

:::caution
The method above is easier and will probably work better.

Requires `chrome://flags` unblocked.
:::

1. head to `chrome://flags`
2. search for "personalization"
3. enable "Personalization Hub UI"
4. restart
5. right click desktop, click "Personalize" (or find "Personalize your device" in settings)
6. go to "Wallpaper" → anything that's not "My Images" (for example: Cityscapes, Heritage, etc)
7. click "Change Daily"
8. it'll throw an error but it changes the wallpaper anyway
9. head back to the main Wallpaper menu again
10. go to "My Images"
11. select whatever image you want
12. you're done! have fun

You have to repeat steps 5-11 every time you restart
