Depending on your ChromeOS version, you may or may not be able to use some kajigs.

## Determine your ChromeOS version

1. Open Settings in ChromeOS
2. Go to `About ChromeOS`
3. Note the characters before the first `.` as your version. (Ex: v132)

## How can I downgrade/recover my Chromebook?

### What versions can I Recover to?

On an unmodified device, you can recover to any version within the range your version is currently in.

import { kernvers } from '../../config.ts';

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Kernver</th>
      <th>ChromeOS Versions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    {Object.entries(kernvers).map(([kv, ver]) => (
      <tr key={kv}>
        <td>{Array.isArray(ver) ? ver[0] : kv}</td>
        <td>{Array.isArray(ver) ? ver[2] : ver}</td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>

If you are looking for what kajigs you can use on your kernver/version, look at [Kajigs](/kajigs/#kajigs)

### Requirements

- USB drive (8 GB+)
- One of the following: [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm) (ChromeOS, Windows, MacOS), `dd{:sh}` (Linux/macOS/POSIX-compliant), or balenaEtcher (Linux, MacOS, Windows)

#### Find your board name

1. Open `chrome://version` on your Chromebook
2. Find **Platform:** row — the word after `stable-channel` is your board name (e.g., **reven**)
   ![Higlighted word reven after stable-channel](/assets/downgrading/chrome_version_platform.png)

:::note
`chrome://version` blocked?

Go to "Settings" (the app) → "About Chrome OS" and you should see a button called "additional details". Click it and then you should be able to copy build details - this is a copy of what is on `chrome://version`. You should be able to paste it and find it. Below is a demo where the board is `reven`.

:::note
Still can't get your board name?

Enter Recovery mode \[Esc+Ref+Pwr], and see the codename at the bottom of the screen. Then, go to [cros.tech](https://cros.tech) and type in the codename. It will show the board.
(If Recovery mode shows `VORTICON`, you are on the `octopus` board.)
:::

### Downloading a recovery image

1. Visit [cros.download](https://cros.download/) and click "Recovery Images".
2. Search for your board name and click the board name in the table.
3. Download the `.zip` file.
4. Find the version you want and click the link in the download column.

### Flash image to USB

#### Using Chromebook Recovery Utility (Windows/macOS/Chrome OS):

1. Install [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm)
2. Open it (click on the extension icon from the puzzle piece)
3. Click the gear icon → "Use local image"
4. Select the `.zip` file
5. Choose your USB drive and create the recovery USB

#### Option 2: balenaEtcher

1. Go to [https://etcher.balena.io/](https://etcher.balena.io/) and download and install balenaEtcher if needed.
2. Click "flash from file" and select the ZIP file (if it fails, unzip it and then try again).
3. Select your USB after clicking "select target".
4. Click "flash".

#### Option 3: Using dd (Linux/macOS/POSIX-compliant):

1. Unzip the `.zip` file either through GUI, or through a command like `unzip{:sh}`
2. Identify your USB device by running `sudo fdisk -l{:sh}` (Linux) or using macOS Disk Utility. It should say something like `Disk /dev/sd...` (Linux) and in macOS open Disk Utility, select it under "External" and you should see `Device:`. You will want to use `/dev/INSERTTHATNAMEHERE` instead of `/dev/sdX`. Other OSes will have to see relevant documentation for identifying the proper USB device.
3. Write the image (replace `/dev/sdX` and file path. Remember to use the unzipped file):

```sh
sudo dd bs=4M if=/PATH/TO/IMAGE.bin of=/dev/sdX conv=sync status=progress
```

:::caution
Double-check the device name to avoid data loss!

### Recover ChromeOS

1. Enter recovery mode: <kbd>Esc</kbd> + <kbd>Refresh</kbd> + <kbd>Power</kbd>
2. Insert recovery USB
3. Follow prompts to reinstall Chrome OS
4. Remove USB when done. You can wipe it in Chrome OS Recovery Utility with gear icon → "erase recovery media". You can `mkfs.ext4{:sh}` on the block device in Linux (on Mac use Disk Utility or CRU).
