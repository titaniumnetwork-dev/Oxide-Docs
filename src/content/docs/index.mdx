title: Titanium Network SDK Documentation
description: This is the official documentation for Titanium Network, an organization dedicated to providing services related to bypassing internet censorship. Our projects expect to provide users and themselves with a less restrictive browsing experience. Here, we provide advanced web proxy services through the progression of web proxy technologies. These projects consist of advanced URL rewriting proxies, webOS projects, web-based emulation built from libretro, kajigs (a repository of device/OS exploits) and web browser experimentations with service workers. As a result, a wide variety of sites are supported, speed is prioritized, and resource consumption has been significantly optimized compared to previous technologies.
