EpoxyTransport is a transport for bare-mux which allows you to use [epoxy-tls](/technologies/epoxy-server) in your bare client.

Usage of this transport is as simple as setting the transport and providing a wisp server. An example is shown below where you get connected to the public testing wisp server.

```js
import { SetTransport } from '@mercuryworkshop/bare-mux';

SetTransport("EpxMod.EpoxyClient", { wisp: "wss://wisp.mercurywork.shop/" });
```

## Building

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```
