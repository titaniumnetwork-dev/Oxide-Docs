EpoxyTransport is a transport for [bare-mux](./bare-mux.mdx) which allows you to use [epoxy-tls](../technologies/epoxy-server.mdx) in your bare client, providing end-to-end encryption for your web proxy traffic.

# Installation

```bash
npm install @mercuryworkshop/epoxy-transport
```

# Basic Usage

```js
import { BareMuxConnection } from "@mercuryworkshop/bare-mux";

const connection = new BareMuxConnection("/baremux/worker.js");

// Set EpoxyTransport with Wisp server
await connection.setTransport("/path/to/epoxy/index.mjs", [{
  wisp: "wss://wisp.mercurywork.shop/"
}]);
```

## Alternative Usage

You can also use the `SetTransport` function for simpler setups:

```js
import { SetTransport } from "@mercuryworkshop/bare-mux";

SetTransport("EpxMod.EpoxyClient", { 
  wisp: "wss://wisp.mercurywork.shop/" 
});
```

:::note
Use `BareMuxConnection` when you need more control over the transport lifecycle, or `SetTransport` for quick setup.
