Bare-mux is a system for managing HTTP transports in projects like [Ultraviolet](/proxies/ultraviolet) or [Scramjet](/proxies/scramjet).
It is responsible for whether libcurl, Epoxy, Bare as module v3, or any other transport is used in those projects.

Written to make the job of creating new standards for transporting http data seamless.

Implements the [TompHTTP Bare](https://github.com/tomphttp/specifications/) client interface in a modular way.

Specifically, this is what allows proxies such as [Nebula](/services/nebula) to switch HTTP transports seamlessly.

A transport is a module that implements the `BareTransport` interface.

```js
export interface BareTransport {
  init: () => Promise<void>;
  ready: boolean;
  connect: (
    url: URL,
    origin: string,
    protocols: string[],
    requestHeaders: BareHeaders,
    onopen: (protocol: string) => void,
    onmessage: (data: Blob | ArrayBuffer | string) => void,
    onclose: (code: number, reason: string) => void,
    onerror: (error: string) => void,
  ) => [( (data: Blob | ArrayBuffer | string) => void, (code: number, reason: string) => void )] => void;

  request: (
    remote: URL,
    method: string,
    body: BodyInit | null,
    headers: BareHeaders,
    signal: AbortSignal | undefined
  ) => Promise<TransferrableResponse>;

  meta: () => BareMeta
}
```

## Upgrading

A guide for updating from v1 to v2 can be found [here](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/bare-mux/blob/master/documentation/Upgrading.md).

### Older bare-mux versions

Starting from v2, bare-mux uses [SharedWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker) to provide stability and improve on resource usage.

If you operate using an older bare-mux, we encourage you to update.

If you can't do either of the above, you can install an outdated and unsupported version of bare-mux.

```bash
npm install @mercuryworkshop/bare-mux@1
```

## Usage

Examples of transports include [EpoxyTransport](/transports/epoxy-transport), [CurlTransport](/transports/curl-transport), and [Bare-Client](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/Bare-as-module3).

Here is an example of using bare-mux:

```js
/// As an end-user
import { BareMuxConnection } from "@mercuryworkshop/bare-mux";
const conn = new BareMuxConnection("/bare-mux/worker.js");
// Set Bare-Client transport
await conn.setTransport("/path/to/transport/index.mjs", ["arg1", { wisp: "wss://wisp.mercurywork.shop" }, "arg3"]);
// Epoxy Client as an example
await conn.setTransport("/epoxy/index.mjs", [{ wisp: "wss://wisp.mercurywork.shop/" }]);
```

```js
/// As a proxy developer
import { BareClient } from "@mercuryworkshop/bare-mux";
const client = new BareClient();
// Fetch
const resp = await client.fetch("https://example.com");
// Create websocket
const ws = client.createWebSocket("wss://echo.websocket.events");
```
