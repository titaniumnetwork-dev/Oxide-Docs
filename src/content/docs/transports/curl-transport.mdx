A bare-module for implementing end-to-end encryption with libcurl.js

# How to use

In an Ultraviolet app with bare-mux installed, you'll see a line like

```js
BareMux.SetTransport("EpxMod.EpoxyClient", { wisp: "ws://localhost:8080/wisp" });
```

Simply replace it with

```js
BareMux.SetTransport("CurlMod.LibcurlClient", { wisp: "ws://localhost:8080/wisp" });
```

to use the libcurl.js backend instead

You must import `dist/index.js` in your service worker, before Ultraviolet is initialized.

## Building

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```

Building on Windows is not supported at this time.
