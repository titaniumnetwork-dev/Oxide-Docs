## Contributions

Server infrastructure costs money and developing this project consumes a lot of my time, so I would appreciate it greatly if you become a Patreon member: [https://www.patreon.com/rammerhead](https://www.patreon.com/rammerhead)

## Features

This proxy supports proxying basically everything except Google logins and a few other notable exceptions such as Netflix, etc.
The proxy allows users to create a "session". When they access their session, their `localStorage` and `cookies` will be synced with Rammerhead. This allows for accurately mocking cookied requests and conveniently saving their logins even if they switch devices. This also enables users to configure a custom HTTP proxy server for Rammerhead to connect to for the session.

## Installation

Rammerhead recommends you to have at least `Node.js v16` to be installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/binary-person/rammerhead
cd rammerhead
npm install
npm run build
node src/server.js
```

## Configuration

Configure your settings in `src/config.js`. If you wish to consistently pull updates from this repo without the hassle of merging, create `config.js` in the root folder so they override the configs in `src/`.
