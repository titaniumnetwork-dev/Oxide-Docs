Scramjet is an interception-based web proxy designed to evade internet censorship, bypass arbitrary web browser restrictions and innovate web proxy technologies. It strives to maintain security, developer friendliness and performance unlike many other web proxies regardless of its open source nature.

Scramjet is currently the flagship web proxy made by [Mercury Workshop](https://mercurywork.shop) and it is **highly recommended that you switch to it**. Don't worry, it is stable enough for most use cases to go into production!

:::note
In the proxy community, you may see it abbreviated as "SJ".

# How to setup Scramjet on your proxy site

1. Install the package: `pnpm i @mercuryworkshop/scramjet@2.0.0-alpha{:sh}`

2. [Setup a transport on your site](../transports/using.mdx)

3. Serve the Scramjet build under your specified route using the path `import { scramjetPath } from "@mercuryworkshop/scramjet/path"{:js}`. We will use `/scram/` as a route for these examples.

4. Write a SW

`sw.js`:

```js
importScripts("/scram/scramjet.all.js");

const { ScramjetServiceWorker } = $scramjetLoadWorker();
const scramjet = new ScramjetServiceWorker();

self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
	event.respondWith(async () => {
    await scramjet.loadConfig();
    if (scramjet.route(event)) {
      return scramjet.fetch(event);
    }

    return fetch(event.request);
  });
});
```

5. Initialize `BareMux` and `ScramjetController`, and register your SW.

Import the scripts in this order:

1. BareMux
2. BareMux Transport of your chioce
3. Scramjet all bundle

In your JS Script:

```js
const { ScramjetController } = $scramjetLoadController();

const scramjet = new ScramjetController({
  files: {
	  wasm: "/scram/scramjet.wasm.wasm",
	  all: "/scram/scramjet.all.js",
	  sync: "/scram/scramjet.sync.js",
  }
});

scramjet.init();

navigator.serviceWorker.register("sw.js");

// Init BareMux
const connection = new BareMux.BareMuxConnection("/baremux/worker.js");
// Set the transport yourself
connection.setTransport(...);
```

## How to setup the Scramjet global types

Add to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "typeRoots": ["@mercuryworkshop/scramjet"]
  },
}
```

## Installing from the CI builds

The CI builds are published per each successful commit after going through less-extensive testing. You can use these if you want a feature, which isn't currently out in the NPM packages.

Instead you would install with `pnpm install https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/scramjet/releases/download/latest/mercuryworkshop-scramjet-1.0.2-dev.tgz{:sh}`

:::note
Fixed types haven't landed in the NPM package yet, so you need to install from the CI builds if you want to take advantage of that.
:::

### Note about upgrading to a new CI build

If you want to upgrade to a new CI build and you use PNPM, as recommended, you must type `pnpm cache delete @mercuryworkshop/scramjet` and then install it again.

# Upgrading

## To 1.0.2-dev+

Now, Scramjet uses a new main bundle `scramjet.all.js`, which combines the former scripts.
Replaces these bundles:

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="/scram/scramjet.worker.js" />
<link rel="prefetch" href="/scram/scramjet.shared.js" />
...
<script src="/scram/scramjet.controller.js"></script>
```

## From Ultraviolet

Scramjet is easier to setup than UV. You may still use UV alongside Scramjet if you really find it necessary, however UV is unmaintained software and has far less site support than Scramjet.

With:

```html
<script src="/scram/scramjet.all.js"></script>
```

# Learn from examples

[Here is an example setup of Scramjet as a proxy site](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/Scramjet-App). If you get lost and need a reference along the way, you can fork it or take inspiration from it. It's essentially Ultraviolet-App, but with Scramjet as the SW proxy instead. It's best used as a reference for migrating from Ultraviolet to Scramjet.

# Official docs

You can read the [full Scramjet Typedocs](https://scramjet.mercurywork.shop/typedoc) for **better API documentation**.
