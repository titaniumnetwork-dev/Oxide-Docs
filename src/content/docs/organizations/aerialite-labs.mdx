"The Sky's the Limit"

Aerialite Labs is a group of developers focused on maintainability, documentation, and availability, while also attempting to push things to their absolute limits.

# Active Projects from them

## Kajigs

- [**Aurora**](/kajigs/aurora.mdx) - Aurora is a tool similar to Ventoy for ChromeOS RMA shims and recovery images based on Alpine Linux

## Services

- [**Mr. Workshop's Download Server**](https://dl.mrwork.shop) - Download Server featuring all relevant shims for ChromeOS devices. Not made to be a rival to vk6's [cros.download](https://cros.download).

# Relations to TN

Aerialite Labs contains all the TitaniumNetwork Librarians, and attempts to maintain the [kajig docs](/kajigs/).

:::note
Aerialite Labs isn't officially partnered with TitaniumNetwork yet. But what are they gonna do. Hire new librarians?
