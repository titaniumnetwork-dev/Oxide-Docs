Mercury Workshop is an organization of developers dedicated to writing free and open source software for everyone.

# Active Projects from them

## Proxies

- [**Scramjet**](../proxies/scramjet.mdx) - Scramjet is an experimental interception based web proxy designed to evade internet censorship, bypass arbitrary web browser restrictions and innovate web proxy technologies. This project strives to maintain security, developer friendliness and performance unlike many other web proxies regardless of its open source nature.

## Services

- [**AnuraOS**](../services/anura.mdx) - The next-gen webOS and development environment with full linux emulation.

## Technologies

- [**Whisper**](../technologies/whisper.mdx) - Whisper is a Wisp protocol client that exposes the Wisp connection over a TUN device.
- [**WispMark**](../technologies/wispmark.mdx) - Wispmark is a benchmarking tool for Wisp protocol implementations.
- [**Workerware**](../technologies/workerware.mdx) - A simple express-style middleware layer for service workers.

### Proxy Server Backends

- [**wisp-server-python**](../technologies/wisp-server-python.mdx) - A Wisp server implementation, written in Python.
- [**wisp-server-node**](../technologies/wisp-server-node.mdx) - A wisp server implementation, written in NodeJS.
- [**Epoxy Server**](../technologies/epoxy-server.mdx) - An encrypted proxy for browser javascript.

## Transports

- [**libcurl.js**](../transports/curl-transport.mdx) - An experimental port of libcurl to WebAssembly for use in the browser, for proxying HTTPS requests with full TLS encryption.
- [**Epoxy**](../transports/epoxy-transport.mdx) - An encrypted proxy for browser javascript.
- [**bare-mux**](../transports/bare-mux.mdx) - A drag-and-drop successor to bare-client (also see [CurlTransport](../transports/curl-transport.mdx) and [EpoxyTransport](../transports/epoxy-transport.mdx)). Soon to be replaced by Bare Client Custom V2.

## Other Notable projects

- [**Dreamland**](https://dreamland.js.org) - A reactive JSX-based rendering library with no virtual DOM.

# Former relations to TN

Mercury Workshop used to be partnered with TN, but in Summer 2025, they decided to split and become independent. While the group remains active, it is **no longer possible to apply to join to MW as a TN member**. A lot of MW members are still active in TN and the proxy community as a whole.
They used to specialize in ChromeOS exploits, and now they focus on web proxies for the use of proxy browsers, and not unblocking. Scramjet is maintained though, and is kept for the proxy community as a whole. They also work on web ports as fun side projects.
