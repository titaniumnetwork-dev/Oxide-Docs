This is an implementation of a [Wisp](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-protocol) server, written in Python. It follows the Wisp v1 spec completely, including support for UDP connections.

This is the fastest implementation of Wisp.

# Installation:

## Install From Source:

Clone [the repository](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-server-python) and cd into it, then run the following commands:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -e .
```

### Install From PyPI:

Run the following command to install this program:

```sh
pip3 install wisp-python
```

# Running the Server:

For the best performance use [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) 3.11 or newer. [PyPy](https://github.com/pypy/pypy) is not recommended as it is a lot slower than CPython here.

To start the server, run `python3 -m wisp.server{:sh}`. The program accepts the following arguments:

```
usage: wisp-server-python [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--static STATIC] [--limits] [--bandwidth BANDWIDTH] [--connections CONNECTIONS] [--window WINDOW] [--allow-loopback] [--allow-private] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL]
                          [--threads THREADS] [--proxy PROXY] [--block-udp] [--block-tcp]

A Wisp server implementation, written in Python (v0.8.1)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host HOST           The hostname the server will listen on.
  --port PORT           The TCP port the server will listen on.
  --static STATIC       Where static files are served from.
  --limits              Enable rate limits.
  --bandwidth BANDWIDTH
                        Bandwidth limit per IP, in kilobytes per second.
  --connections CONNECTIONS
                        New connections limit per IP.
  --window WINDOW       Fixed window length for rate limits, in seconds.
  --allow-loopback      Allow connections to loopback IP addresses.
  --allow-private       Allow connections to private IP addresses.
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        The log level (either debug, info, warning, error, or critical).
  --threads THREADS     The number of threads to run the server on. By default it uses all CPU cores. (Linux only)
  --proxy PROXY         The url of the socks5h, socks5, sock4a, socks4 or http proxy to use.
  --block-udp           Block UDP streams.
  --block-tcp           Block TCP streams.
```

# Roadmap:

- ~~Rate limits~~
- JSON based config files
- ~~UDP support~~
- ~~Ability to block local addresses~~
- Wisp v2 support
