Wisp protocol client that exposes the Wisp connection over a TUN device.

## When is this useful?

Many institutions are employing [NGFW (Next Generation Firewall)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-next-generation-firewall-ngfw/) technology that can identify and block encrypted VPN traffic through the use of DPI (deep packet inspection).

To circumvent this, Whisper can be used to create a TUN device that routes all internet traffic through a select Wisp server. All traffic will be indistinguishable from typical WebSocket traffic.

## Whisper usage examples

### Linux

```sh
whisper --tun tun0 --url wss://nebulaproxy.io/wisp/
```

### Windows

```sh
whisper.exe --tun tun0 --url wss://nebulaproxy.io/wisp/
```

## Arguments

| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wisp`    | Name of created TUN device                                                          |
| `tun`     | MTU of created TUN device                                                           |
| `ip`      | IP address of created TUN device                                                    |
| `mask`    | Mask of created TUN device (defaults to `/0`)                                       |

## Compiling

Whisper should compile on all major operating systems.

Ensure you have the Rust Nightly Toolchain installed.

```sh
cargo build --release
```
