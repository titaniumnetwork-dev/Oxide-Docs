An open source alternative to Double Counter. Known within the Titanium Network community as "Cybermonay" or "Proxyguard". Created in response to mistrust of DC's development team as well as a desire to put control of network data back in the hands of our users.

## Prerequisites

- Bun (1.0.0+)
- PostgreSQL

## Running

Copy `example.env` to `.env`

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

From there, edit the `.env` file with the required details. Do not share the `.env` file with anyone, as it will allow them to take full control of Serverguard.

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - The token for your Discord bot.

- `APPLICATION_ID` - The application ID of your Discord bot.

- `CLIENT_ID` - The client ID of your Discord bot.

- `CLIENT_SECRET` - The client secret of your Discord bot.

- `REDIRECT_URI` - A redirect URI that will be navigated to by the user once they verify with Serverguard.

- `DB_USER` - PostgreSQL username

- `DB_HOST` - Host for your PostgreSQL server (probably `localhost`)

- `DB_PASSWORD` - Password for your PostgreSQL server

- `DB_PORT` - Port for your PostgreSQL server (probably `5432`)

- `SALT` - A custom salt to be added to the user IP address before hashing.

- `ROLE_ID` - Verification role

- `ALT_ROLE_ID` - A role to assign flagged alt accounts

- `GUILD_ID` - The ID of the server you wish to use Serverguard in

- `MUTED_ROLE_ID` - The ID of a role that mutes a user.
