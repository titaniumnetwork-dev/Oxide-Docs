Performant server implementation of the [Wisp](/wisp) protocol in Rust, made for epoxy.

You can view a recent flamegraph of the server under load [here](flamegraph.svg?raw=true).

## Building

:::caution
Rust nightly is required.
:::

```bash
cargo b -r
```

The executable will be placed at `target/release/epoxy-server`.
You can optionally add the environment variable `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"` to optimize for the current CPU.

## Configuration

`epoxy-server` is configured through a configuration file in either TOML, JSON, or YAML. Pass the configuration file's path as an argument to `epoxy-server`.

The defaults can be printed with the command line option `--default-config` and the configuration file format can be changed from the default of TOML with the command line option `--format`.
